# SystemClient
This is Android-client for Server (at folder "Server"). Server connects to database and send request for it. Android apllication connects to Server, works with data and sends or receives request from Server. 
<p>Server works with database of System in my other repository. It gets, updates and deletes an information from tables. 
<p>Only registered users can use this client. Those users are professors (for now). They see information about groups, their subjects, tasks and works of students. They can update, add or delete data. Also they can receive push message about new works for their subjects.
<p>Future plans include revision of the application, add adding functionality and other users (students).
